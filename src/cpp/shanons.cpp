/* Shanon-Hartley Theorem

@Description:
		The Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem states the channel capacity C {\displaystyle C} C, 
		meaning the theoretical tightest upper bound on the information rate of data that
		can be communicated at an arbitrarily low error rate using an average received 
		signal power S {\displaystyle S} S through an analog communication channel subject
		to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of power N {\displaystyle N} N:
@Formula
	C = B * log (base2) (1 + SNR)    b/s
